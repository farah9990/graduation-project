### Initial design 
App Purpose: At the top of the screen, display the title "AI Voice Detector".

Percentage Circle: In the center of the screen, there is a circular progress bar to display the percentage of sound detection progress. Initially, it is set to 0% or an empty circuit. The circle can be gradually filled in as the detection process progresses.

Start discovery button: Below the percentage circle, a button with the text “Verify.” Users will click this button to start the sound detection process, currently it only produces random percentages until it is developed later.
Download Audio button: It is a button that enables you to access audio clips on your device.
Audio clip field: Next to the "up" button, there should be an empty text field (or label) at the beginning, where the name of the audio clip selected by the user will appear.
